We are coming from a chapter focused on integration. At this point, you’ve built up a strong intuition 
for how to tackle most integrals you encounter. So let’s start today with a problem that looks familiar... but hides a deeper challenge.
</p>

<activity xml:id="intro-series-hook">
  <title>(10 Minute) -- Warmup</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      To begin our exploration of infinite series, let's consider the integral <me>\int \frac{\sin x}{x}\,dx</me>.
    </p>
  </introduction>

    <task>

    <statement>
    <p> 
      Working with a partner (a nearby neighbor) each person try to evaluate the integral using 
      one or two of our integration techniques we have learned so far. 
      <ul>
        <li>U-Substitution</li>
        <li>Integration by Parts</li>
        <li>Triginometric Substitution</li>
        <li>Partial Fractions</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    </statement>
  </task>
  <task>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Discuss! Were you able to make any progress? Once you have throroughly tried the problem and discussed, feel free to look at the <alert>Solution</alert> below. 
       </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        It turns out the integral, <m>\displaystyle \int \dfrac{\sin x}{x}~dx</m>, does <em>not</em> have a closed-form antiderivative that can be expressed using elementary functions. 
        In fact, it defines a new function called the <term>sine integral</term>, often written as <m>\operatorname{Si}(x)</m>.
      </p>


      <figure xml:id="wolfram1">
        <caption>Showing the result of <m>\displaystyle \int \dfrac{\sin x}{x}~dx</m> in Wolfram Alpha</caption>
    <image source="images/si(x).PNG" width="80%"/>
</figure>


      <p>
        So, what can we do when integration fails to give us a simple formula?
        This is where the idea of representing a function as an infinite polynomial (<term>a power series</term>) comes in!
      </p>
    </solution>
  </task>

</activity>

<p>
The integral we just explored hinted that our familiar tools sometimes fall short. 
To find new ones, we need to broaden our notion of what it means to “add things up.” 
It might sound strange, but adding up <em>infinitely many</em> terms can sometimes make 
perfect sense and even produce nice reasonable (finite) values. To showcase this, let’s explore a simple example.
</p>


<activity xml:id="finite-vs-infinite-sums">
  <title>(5 Minute) --  Infinite Sums</title>

  <introduction>
      <p>
        Consider the sum:
        <me> \dfrac{1}{2} + \dfrac{1}{4} + \dfrac{1}{8} + \dfrac{1}{16} + \cdots</me>
      </p>
  </introduction>

  <task>
    <statement>

      <p>
        Represent this quantity geometrically by: 
        <ul>
          <li>Sketch a large 1 by 1 square on your paper, which has an area of 1.</li>
          <li>Shade half of it to represent <m>\dfrac{1}{2}</m>.</li>
          <li>Then shade half of the remaining space for <m>\dfrac{1}{4}</m>, then half again for <m>\dfrac{1}{8}</m>, and continue the pattern.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

    </statement>
  </task>

  <task>
    <statement>
      <p>
        What do you notice as you continue? 
        How much of the square will be shaded if we keep repeating this process forever?
      </p>
    </statement>
  </task>


<task>
    <statement>
      <p>
        We have just reasoned out that the infinite sum:  
        <me> \dfrac{1}{2} + \dfrac{1}{4} + \dfrac{1}{8} + \dfrac{1}{16} + \cdots =\; ?</me>        
        Verify that you have the same answer as your neighbor before checking the <alert>Solution</alert> below.
      </p>
    </statement>



    <solution>
<p>
As you continue shading, each new step fills in half of whatever portion of the square remains unshaded. 
If you repeat this process indefinitely, you will come arbitrarily close to shading the entire square.
</p>

      <sidebyside width = "70%">
<figure>
  <caption>
    Shading in the box
  </caption>
  <image width = "100%" source="images/boxGif.gif">
  </image>
</figure>
</sidebyside>



<p>
This visual demonstrates that adding more and more pieces brings us closer and closer to a total area of 1. 
If the process continued forever, the shaded area would become indistinguishable from the full square itself. 
Therefore,
<me>\dfrac{1}{2} + \dfrac{1}{4} + \dfrac{1}{8} + \dfrac{1}{16} + \cdots = 1.</me>
</p>



    </solution>
  </task>
</activity>

<p>
Just as our study of arithmetic began with performing operations on numbers (adding, subtracting, and so on) 
and then expanded to performing those same operations on functions involving variables like <m>x</m>, we can now take the next step. 
Since we’ve seen that adding infinitely many numbers can sometimes produce a meaningful result, it’s natural to ask: 
what happens if we add infinitely many powers of <m>x</m>? 
This idea leads us to the concept of an <term>infinite polynomial</term>, more formally known as a <term>power series</term>.
</p>


<definition xml:id="def-power-series-0">
  <title>Power Series Centered at 0</title>
  <statement>
    <p>
      A <term>power series</term> is an infinite polynomial  of the form
      <me>
        f(x) = a_0 + a_1x + a_2x^2 + a_3x^3 + \cdots  
      </me>
      where the coefficients <m>a_n</m> are constants and <m>x</m> is the variable.
    </p>
  </statement>
</definition>

  <remark>
    <title>The Center of a Power Series</title>
    
    
    <p>
      Technically, this is a <term>power series centered at 0</term>. 
      Later, we will extend the idea to series centered at other points, such as <m>x = a</m>. 
      For now, we will focus on series centered at 0, and by convention, if the center is not specified, it is understood to be 0.
    </p>
  </remark>

<definition xml:id="def-maclaurin-series">
  <title>Maclaurin Series</title>
  <statement>
    <p>
      A <term>Maclaurin series</term> is a specific type of power series. When creating a Maclaurin series, each coefficient 
      is determined 
      so that the polynomial and the original function share the same value and <em>all</em> matching derivatives at <m>x = 0</m>. 
      This ensures that the series “behaves like” the function near the origin.
    </p>
  </statement>
</definition>

<p>
To see how this definition works in practice, let’s create a Maclaurin series together! 
</p>

<example xml:id="ex-maclaurin-sin">
  <title>(Together as Class) -- Maclaurin Series for <m>\sin(x)</m></title>
  <statement>
    <p>
      Find the first 5 terms of the Maclaurin series for <m>f(x) = \sin(x)</m>. 
    </p>
  </statement>

  <solution>
    <p> <alert> This solution is for instructors only and would be removed for the student facing document. The intent is for
      this problem to be done in class together. </alert>
    </p>
  <p>
    Let <m>f(x)=\sin(x)</m> and suppose a Maclaurin polynomial
  </p>
  <me>
    P(x)=a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + a_3 x^3 + a_4 x^4 + a_5 x^5 + \cdots
  </me>

  <p>
    We want the value and <em>all</em> matching derivatives to agree at <m>x=0</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>Match the value:</em><br/>
    We want <m>f(0)=P(0)</m> so
  </p>
  <p>
    <m>\sin(0)=a_0 + 0 + 0 + \cdots</m> hence <m>0=a_0</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>Match the first derivative:</em><br/>
    We want <m>f'(0)=P'(0)</m>. Compute
  </p>
  <p>
    <m>f'(x)=\cos(x)</m> and <m>P'(x)=a_1 + 2a_2 x + 3a_3 x^2 + 4a_4 x^3 + 5a_5 x^4 + \cdots</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Plugging in <m>x=0</m> gives <m>\cos(0)=0 + a_1 + 0 + 0 + \cdots</m>, so <m>1=a_1</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>Match the second derivative:</em><br/>
    <m>f''(x)=-\sin(x)</m> and <m>P''(x)=2a_2 + 6a_3 x + 12a_4 x^2 + 20a_5 x^3 + \cdots</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    At <m>x=0</m>: <m>-\sin(0)=2a_2</m>, so <m>0=2a_2</m> and thus <m>a_2=0</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>Match the third derivative:</em><br/>
    <m>f^{(3)}(x)=-\cos(x)</m> and <m>P^{(3)}(x)=6a_3 + 24a_4 x + 60a_5 x^2 + \cdots</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    At <m>x=0</m>: <m>-\cos(0)=6a_3</m>, so <m>-1=6a_3</m> and <m>a_3=-\dfrac{1}{6}</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>Match the fourth derivative:</em><br/>
    <m>f^{(4)}(x)=\sin(x)</m> and <m>P^{(4)}(x)=24a_4 + 120a_5 x + \cdots</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    At <m>x=0</m>: <m>\sin(0)=24a_4</m>, so <m>0=24a_4</m> and <m>a_4=0</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>Match the fifth derivative:</em><br/>
    <m>f^{(5)}(x)=\cos(x)</m> and <m>P^{(5)}(x)=120a_5 + \cdots</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    At <m>x=0</m>: <m>\cos(0)=120a_5</m>, so <m>1=120a_5</m> and <m>a_5=\dfrac{1}{120}</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Substituting these into <m>P(x)</m> gives, term by term,
  </p>
  <me>
    \sin(x) =x - \frac{x^3}{6} + \frac{x^5}{120} - \cdots
  </me>
</solution>

  <answer>
    <p>
      <me>
        \sin(x) = x - \frac{x^3}{6} + \frac{x^5}{120} + \cdots
      </me>
    </p>
  </answer>

</example>

<p>
Stopping after a certain number of terms and using that polynomial to approximate the function has a name!
</p>


<definition xml:id="def-maclaurin-polynomial">
  <title>Maclaurin Polynomial</title>
  <statement>
    <p>
      A <term>Maclaurin polynomial</term> is formed by stopping a Maclaurin series after a finite number of terms. 
      The resulting polynomial can be used to approximate the function near <m>x = 0</m>.
    </p>
    <p> Our answer from <xref ref="ex-maclaurin-sin" /> would be called the "5th degree Maclaurin polynomial of sin(x)"
    </p>

  </statement>

</definition>

  <remark>
    <title>Accuracy</title>
    
    
    <p>
      The Maclaurin polynomial provides a practical approximation to the original function when only a few terms are used. 
      Including more terms generally makes the approximation more accurate near the origin.

        Describe in words how the Maclaurin polynomail graph changes as we add more terms. 
      </p>
    </statement>

  <answer>
    <p>
      As more terms are added, each higher-degree Maclaurin polynomial matches <m>\sin(x)</m> more closely near the origin. 
      The curve of the polynomial begins to follow the shape of the sine wave for a wider interval before it starts to diverge. 
      In other words, the approximation becomes more accurate not only at <m>x = 0</m> but also over a larger region around it.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, <m>P_1(x) = x</m> only matches <m>\sin(x)</m> very close to 0, 
      while <m>P_3(x)</m> and <m>P_5(x)</m> capture more of the curvature. 
      By the time we reach <m>P_{10}(x)</m> or even <m>P_{100}(x)</m>, the polynomial is nearly indistinguishable from <m>\sin(x)</m> 
      across most of the graphing window before eventually diverging for very large <m>x</m>.
    </p>
  </answer>    
  </task>
</activity>


<p>
As we’ve just seen, the graphs of the Maclaurin polynomials and the function <m>\sin(x)</m> lie very close together when <m>x</m> is near 0. 
Because the curves are so similar in that region, their function values are also nearly the same. 
This reveals one of the main uses of Maclaurin series and polynomials... using them to approximate the values of more complicated functions.
</p>


<example xml:id="ex-sin-approx">
  <title>(Together as Class) -- Approximating Using a Maclaurin Polynomial</title>
  <statement>
    <p>

  <answer>
    <p>

      <me>
        P_3(0.5) = 0.5 - \frac{(0.5)^3}{6} = \frac{23}{48} \approx 0.479167.

      showing that even a 3rd-degree Maclaurin polynomial gives a very accurate estimate near <m>x = 0</m>.

<p>
Everything we’ve explored today, from discovering that <m>\displaystyle \int \frac{\sin x}{x}\,dx</m> has no simple formula, 
to realizing that infinite sums can approximate functions, and finally learning how to build Maclaurin Series...  
has been leading to this moment! 
We now have the tools to tackle a problem that once seemed impossible. 
By using our Maclaurin polynomial, we can approximate not just function values like <m>\sin(0.5)</m>, 
but even the integral that started our entire discussion.

This lesson marks the beginning of a much larger journey. 
In the next part of this chapter, we’ll dive into the details of how and when these infinite sums actually "work". We'll be
examining convergence, divergence, and the boundaries of where our approximations hold true. 
Some of that work will feel technical, even a little dry at times, but remember what you’ve seen today: 
with the right tools, we can approximate the unapproachable and make sense of the impossible. </p> <p> 
If you ever feel buried in the details, I recommend that think back to this lesson and remember what
our end goal is!
