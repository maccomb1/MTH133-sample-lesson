  <introduction>
    <p>
      To begin our exploration of infinite series, let's consider the integral <me>\int \frac{\sin x}{x}\,dx</me>.
    </p>

    <statement>
    <p> 
      Working with a partner (a nearby neighbor) each person try to evaluate the integral using 
      one or two of our integration techniques we have learned so far. 
      <ul>
        <li>U-Substitution</li>
        <li>Integration by Parts</li>
        <li>Triginometric Substitution</li>
        <li>Partial Fractions</li>
      </ul>

    <solution>
      <p>
        It turns out the integral, <m>\displaystyle \int \dfrac{\sin x}{x}~dx</m>, does <em>not</em> have a closed-form antiderivative that can be expressed using elementary functions. 
        In fact, it defines a new function called the <term>sine integral</term>, often written as <m>\operatorname{Si}(x)</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        So, what can we do when integration fails to give us a simple formula?
        This is where the idea of representing a function as an <term>infinite polynomial</term>—a power series—comes in.
